        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Speed, A graduate from the Department of Chemistry, Obafemi Awolowo University, resides in Ibadan. For the past two years, I've been into the tech space, I am a UI/UX designer with few years of experience. I want to learn front-end development so as to make my on website live becaause most of the designs i've done have been developed wrongly, So i came across <a href="www.twitter.com/Thejustproject" class="tjp">THE JUST PROJECT</a> on twitter through my good friend (Valerie) and decided to register to kickstart my career in Web development</p>
